payload = { }
token = JWT.encode payload, 'eyJkYXRhIjoidGVzdCJ9', 'HS256'

Authentication Strategy is encrypt and decrypt by users own password ( non expiring)

(1) Encrypt data in certain way with Author's(user) own given password using JWT
(2) System retreives users stored password and try to decrypt , unsuccessful decrypt is Unauthorized attempt
